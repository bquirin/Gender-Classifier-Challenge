# Gender-Classifier-Challenge

#Overview  

This is the code for the Gender Classifier challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #1' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the scikit-learn library to access the tree and neighbors library to perform classification using a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female to predict the gender of someone given a set of body metrics. 

#Dependencies  

scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 
Install missing dependencies using pip  

#Usage  

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via GenderClassifier.py 

##Challenge

This challenge involved using several types of classifiers and identifying which one yields better results.
